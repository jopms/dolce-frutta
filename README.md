You can also add and remove items from your basket, which remains persistently accessible within your browser.
All the implementations were done taking into consideration the business aspect, with focus on mantaining a clean design.

## API
The project uses the [Predic8 API](https://api.predic8.de/shop/v2/swagger-ui/index.html#) to fetch products and vendors.

This API provides the necessary data to populate our online grocery shop with premium Italian fresh fruits.

The design was implemented to ensure that the user interactions with the online grocery shop remain smooth and responsive. The goal is to provide an enjoyable exploration of premium Italian fresh fruits, regardless of any potential delays in the API response.

Feel free to savor the flavors, explore the offerings, and experience the bounty of Italy's finest produce in our React-powered online grocery shop.
